		<div class="history">
			<p>Blackjack's precursor was <span class="italic">twenty-one</span>, a game of unknown origin. The first written reference is found in a book written between 1601 and 1602 by the Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes, implying that <span class="italic">"ventiuna"</span> (Spanish for twenty-one) was played in Castile since the beginning of the 17th century or earlier. Later references to this game are found in France and Spain. When twenty-one was introduced in the United States, gambling houses offered bonus payouts to stimulate players' interest. One such bonus was a ten-to-one payout if the player's hand consisted of the ace of spades and a black jack (either the jack of clubs or the jack of spades). This hand was called a <span class="italic">"blackjack"</span>, and even though the ten-to-one bonus was soon withdrawn, the name stuck to the game. In the modern game, a blackjack refers to any hand of an ace plus a ten or face card regardless of suits or colors.</p>
